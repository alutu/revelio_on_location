This is the version of Revelio inclusing the port-preservation test for CGN detection. 
This version is a one-off version of Revelio, and does not include the pathchar algorithm. 
Revelio receives here as input a unique identifier for the location from where the user is running the test. 
To run Revelio-on-location and send the results to our test server (located at zompopo.it.uc3m.es), run the following:
$ sudo bash run_Revelio.sh revelio_on_location [your-location-code]
