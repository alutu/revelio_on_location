This is the version of Revelio including the port-preservation test for CGNAT detection in the ISP network. 
This version is a one-off version of Revelio, and does not include the pathchar algorithm. 
Revelio receives here as input a unique identifier for the location from where the user is running the test. 
To run revelio-on-location and send the results to our test server (located at zompopo.it.uc3m.es), run the following:

$ sudo bash run_Revelio.sh [revelio_on_location_version] [your-location-code]

e.g.:
$ sudo bash run_Revelio.sh revelio_on_location_x86_64 UC3M-Leganes

NOTE: run the command above from the directory "revelio_on_location/"
*The binary depends on the library miniupnpc: http://miniupnp.free.fr/*

To install on Linux/GNU:
$ sudo apt-get install miniupnpc miniupnpc_i386

You can find two different versions of the binary: 
- revelio_on_location_x86_64 --> compiled for Linux/GNU for 64bits (x86_64) 
- revelio_on_location_i386   --> compiled for Linux/GNU for 32bits (i386)
The location code should not be longer than 100 characters and need to be manually generated by the user.
